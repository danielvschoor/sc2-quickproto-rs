# sc2-quickproto-rs

SC2 protocol buffers generated using [quick-protobuf](https://github.com/tafia/quick-protobuf).

## Note
A lot of the generated code had to be changed by hand to make it work. A fork of [quick-protobuf](https://github.com/tafia/quick-protobuf) was also needed 
to compile SC2's protobuf.
